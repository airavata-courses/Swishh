# Swishh

The power of photography: time, mortality and memory. Thanks to the emerging technologies, capturing memories is a virtue that all of us are blessed with. Photography opens our eyes and heart. It can take us behind to just yesterday or to our grandparents, keeping memories vivid in our hearts. 
Even though we have ability to take hundreds if not thousands of photos everyday, storing and managing them becomes a hassle. This is when our image management application, **Swishh** can come to your rescue! Swishh is a image storage application with advanced features like searching based on location and other tags and sharing with other authentic users. This application has a cloud based architecture and hence can scale upto your needs. 
Please continue reading this article to know Swishh better. 

Registered users are required to login to Swishh to upload or access already uploaded images. Once they are authenticated with a secure login, they are now redirected to the Dashboard which has a gallery view of all their previously uploaded media. These can be sorted based on filters, searched through using keywords and also can be shared to other authentic users. Apart from that users can also upload new images from their local machines.
