# Swishh
Spring 2021 Project 

The power of photography: time, mortality and memory. Thanks to the emerging technologies, capturing memories is a virtue that all of us are blessed with. Photography opens our eyes and heart. It can take us behind to just yesterday or to our grandparents, keeping memories vivid in our hearts. 
Even though we have ability to take hundreds if not thousands of photos everyday, storing and managing them becomes a hassle. This is when our image management application, Swishh can come to your rescue! Swishh is a image storage application with advanced features like searching based on location and other tags and sharing with other authentic users. This application has a cloud based architecture and hence can scale upto your needs.
